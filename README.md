# mqtt-websocket

MQTT-Websocket is a demonstration of connecting to an MQTT server via
websockets entirely in javascript and the browser.

There are not a lot of examples out there, and those that exist are riddled
with amaturity, as if handing in a school project at the last minute.  In an
attempt to clean up code and make it easier to both read and modify, a new
example has been written.

This is not to say that it does not have issues on its own, my example has
no input validation (a production no-no), and could use more documentation.

Within this repository, the example can be found in the `gh-pages` branch.
